# Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. Youâ€™ve been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

Tasks
As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this: brainstorm ideas, and pitching projects.

## Brainstorming Ideas
Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

### Yvette - 
- The project I would like to suggest is a tracking program for the popular Beachbody workout LIIFT4. It has many thousands of users that complete multiple rounds of the 8 week program. Each day of the week focuses on a specific muscle group and entails different size weights and as the person progresses through the weeks, they would naturally change up in weights.
- The tracking program would utilize a form to enter in the round number they are on, the week they are on, then the day would be a dropdown as to which muscle group and would show the moves for that day, they would also enter the weights they used for each move. 
  - Optionally, they could enter their weight.
- I envision that someone could edit a workout's data, but also should be able to see what weights they used for the past couple rounds for the same week or same muscle group or something, so they would be able to select what they want to display data on
- For the API(s), I'm not real sure on this, but it could be as simple as a motivational sayings API that would display a saying each time they logged in or a water tracking API or something

### Adara - 
I really like the anime API's I really hope to use those. I also like the animals and art and design ones too. I'm not sure what ideas I all have though. I'm gonna have to find ideas from other people and maybe branch off of those. Maybe a little slideshow on the homepage with some featured animes and as they show up in the slideshow the bottom icons will glow kind of? And they can add those to a wishlist maybe? Or watchlist rather. With the animal one maybe we could make an adoption page.

## Pitching a Project
Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.

## Create your Pitch
Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

Each pitch should contain the following information:

## Name of Project

## Summary of idea.
What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
